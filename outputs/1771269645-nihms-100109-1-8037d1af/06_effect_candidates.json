Additionally, for fathers only, two variables evidenced modifications to the pre-birth rate of change following the birth of the baby. Compared to their non-significant increases in relationship confidence before birth, fathers reported significant gradual decreases after birth (p < .05). Additionally, although fathers did not report any mean changes in problem intensity immediately following birth (in contrast to their wives), fathers reported a steady increase in problem intensity following birth (p < .01) compared to their pre-birth reports. Gender Differences in Change in Relationship Functioning After Birth: Given that the model selection criteria suggested gender differences in the best-fitting models for half of the relationship variables examined in the present study, it was important to determine whether mothers and fathers showed significant differences in relationship functioning after birth. To 5In all cases, Cohen’s d was computed by dividing the estimate of the sudden change by the standard deviation of the intercept (the estimated level of the construct at birth) obtained from the HLM program. 6The full results for the MAT are not reported here to save space. However, the one-item measure of satisfaction and the full MAT were highly correlated (r = .82 for fathers and r = .57 for mothers) and showed similar changes over time. Specifically, the full MAT demonstrated a sudden drop of 6.31 points for mothers (d = -.66, p < .001) and 5.63 points for fathers (d = -.56, p < .01) following the birth of the first baby.

To this end, we compared, in two ways, couples who received the typical premarital education through the religious organization where they were getting married with couples who received the empirically-based premarital education program (PREP). First, the sample was split into couples that did and did not receive PREP, and the best fitting models in each of the four samples was determined using the BIC procedures above. The results revealed no systematic differences based on the type of education received. In a second approach, receipt of PREP was entered in each best-fitting model as a predictor of parents’ changes attributable to the birth of their baby. In all cases, premarital education group did not significantly predict parents’ changes following birth (all ps > .25). Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that the impact of birth on relationship functioning does not depend on the type of premarital education received.

This centering allowed us to examine whether relationship events other than birth of child (i.e., history or instrumentation effects) were viable explanations for the pattern of change in relationship functioning observed in parents. Other than this difference in centering, the same analytical and model-fitting procedure used in Study 1 was applied in Study 2. Change Within the Non-Parent Sample: When the twelve models in Figure 1 were fit to the non-parent sample, all of the relationship constructs showed only linear or linear and quadratic change; there was no evidence of change in intercepts or slopes at the time when parents were showing such changes for these relationship variables (Table 5). As presented in Table 5, marital satisfaction showed significant linear declines over time (p < .001). Men and women also demonstrated significant decreases in negative observed communication over the course of the study (all p < .001).

However, Huston and Holmes conclude “The preponderance of the data fail to support the view that parenthood typically undermines marital satisfaction” (2004, p. 109). These disagreements arise primarily from the different methodologies that have been used to study the effect of the transition to parenthood; therefore, these methodologies are reviewed below. Impact of the Transition to Parenthood on Relationships Cross-Sectional Studies of Parenthood One of the most straightforward ways to examine the impact of having a child is to conduct a cross-sectional study comparing parents with non-parents. In the most recent meta-analysis of this research, parents reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction than non-parents (d = -.19; Twenge, Campbell, & Foster, 2003). Although this finding provides preliminary support for the notion that having a child is associated with declines in relationship quality, there are important limitations of cross-sectional designs in determining the true effect. Parents and non- parents are not equivalent groups and, as identified by Huston and Holmes (2004), parents may be less satisfied than non-parents for several other reasons: 1) they may be less satisfied even before having children; 2) having children serves as a barrier to divorce but not to dissatisfaction; 3) couples who become parents may differ from non-parents in other unmodeled but meaningful ways; and 4) a cross-sectional sample of parents is likely to include relationships of longer duration than a sample of non-parents. Thus, cross-sectional designs can provide only limited unmode",

      "value_text": "This longitudinal study examined the effect of the birth of the first child on relationship functioning using data from 218 couples (436 individuals) over the course of the first 8 years of marriage. Compared to pre-birth levels and trajectories, parents showed sudden deterioration following birth on observed and self-reported measures of positive and negative aspects of relationship functioning. The deterioration in these variables was small to medium in size and tended to persist throughout the remaining years of the study. Mothers and fathers showed similar amounts of change after birth. The amount of post-birth deterioration in relationship functioning varied systematically by several characteristics of the individual, the marriage, and the pregnancy itself. In a group of couples who did not have children, results indicated more gradual deterioration in relationship functioning during the first 8 years of marriage without the sudden changes seen in parents, suggesting that the results seen in the parent sample may be due to birth. Keywords Transition to parenthood; Parent; Relationship functioning; Prediction For decades, the marital and family literature has debated whether having a baby causes substantial declines in the average couple’s relationship. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this question. For married couples, the first child is often born within the first five years of marriage - a period that has been shown to hold the highest risk for divorce (Bramlett & Mosher, 2001). If parenthood truly is a crisis, as suggested by early investigators (e.g., Lemasters, 1957), then clarification of the impact of a baby’s birth could lead to increased understanding of early marital difficulties. Moreover, the quality of a couple’s relationship following a",

This strategy maximizes the ability to examine changes in levels and trajectories of the measured constructs before and after having a baby. Model estimation: Models 1a, 2a, and 3a were tested using parameterizations of an intercept- only model (Model 1a), an intercept + linear time model (Model 2a) and an intercept + linear time + quadratic time (Model 3a). Models 1b, 2b, and 3b were tested by adding a single variable (“level”) to the base models that had a value of zero for all assessments that occurred before the birth of a couple’s child and a value of 1 for all the assessments that occurred after the birth. For example, Model 3b was tested by fitting Equation 1 to the data: (1) Fixed effects at level one were allowed to vary randomly at level two if the difference in log likelihoods between models with and without the random effect was significant.

As with the parent sample, the type of premarital education received did not affect the selection of the best-fitting model. Participants: In Study 2, data from 86 couples who did not have children before or during the first eight years of the study (“non-parents”) were used as a non-equivalent control group. When they began participation, non-parents were 26.34 years old (SD = 4.91), on average, with Doss et al. Page 15 J Pers Soc Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript 15.08 years of education (SD = 1.77). The median personal income level was $20.000-29.999 and they were 90.1% White, 5.2% Latino, and 2.3% African American; 2.4% were of some other race/ethnicity. Seventy five percent of non-parents cohabited before marriage. Twenty seven percent of couples reported attending church at least once a week and, on average, couples described themselves as “somewhat” religious. During the course of the present study, 18 couples divorced and 22 withdrew from participation. This divorce rate is consistent with previous longitudinal research of non-parents that begins just after marriage (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000). All available data from the couples that divorced and withdrew were included in the analyses below, allowing for estimates of change to be fit for the majority of these couples who did not provide full data. As expected based on previous studies, there were a few differences between the parents in Study 1 and the non-parents in Study 2 at the initial assessment.

Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript impacted the results. To this end, we compared, in two ways, couples who received the typical premarital education through the religious organization where they were getting married with couples who received the empirically-based premarital education program (PREP). First, the sample was split into couples that did and did not receive PREP, and the best fitting models in each of the four samples was determined using the BIC procedures above. The results revealed no systematic differences based on the type of education received. In a second approach, receipt of PREP was entered in each best-fitting model as a predictor of parents’ changes attributable to the birth of their baby. In all cases, premarital education group did not significantly predict parents’ changes following birth (all ps > .25). Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that the impact of birth on relationship functioning does not depend on the type of premarital education received.

Prior to analysis, the time (in years) of each parent’s assessment was centered on the birth of the couple’s child so that the intercept represented the estimated mean level of the relationship construct at the time of birth. This strategy maximizes the ability to examine changes in levels and trajectories of the measured constructs before and after having a baby. Model estimation: Models 1a, 2a, and 3a were tested using parameterizations of an intercept- only model (Model 1a), an intercept + linear time model (Model 2a) and an intercept + linear time + quadratic time (Model 3a). Models 1b, 2b, and 3b were tested by adding a single variable (“level”) to the base models that had a value of zero for all assessments that occurred before the birth of a couple’s child and a value of 1 for all the assessments that occurred after the birth. For example, Model 3b was tested by fitting Equation 1 to the data: (1) Fixed effects at level one were allowed to vary randomly at level two if the difference in log likelihoods between models with and without the random effect was significant. Models 1c, 2c, 3c as well as 1d, 2d, and 3d were fit to the data using a piecewise model (e.g., Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002) that estimated a linear rate of change before birth and a separate linear rate of change after birth that captured deviations from the pre-birth rate of change.3 Model fit: To determine the best-fitting model of the eight potential models for each dependent variable, values of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) were calculated from the log-likelihood statistic obtained for each model using Full Maximum Likelihood estimation; these values were examined separately for each gender",
