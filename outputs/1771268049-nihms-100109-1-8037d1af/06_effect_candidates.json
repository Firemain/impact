When the same parameters were not included in both fathers’ and mothers’ best-fitting model, the parameter being tested was included for both partners and constrained to be equal. Results revealed that, of the six relationship variables, only two showed significant gender differences in sudden gains (Table 3). Specifically, mothers, compared to fathers, showed significantly larger sudden increases in problem intensity (χ2(1) = 13.41, p < .001) and poor conflict management (χ2(1) = 4.18, p < .05). There were no significant gender differences in post-birth gradual changes. Between-Individual Variability in Change in Relationship Functioning After Birth: The third question posed by the present study was whether or not there was significant variability in individuals’ reactions to the transition to parenthood. Results indicated that fathers’ and mothers’ sudden changes in relationship satisfaction, problem intensity, and relationship dedication varied significantly between individuals (Table 2). In other words, there was significant variability in individual trajectories around the average trajectories for changes over time. Additionally, mothers’ sudden changes in poor conflict management and relationship confidence showed significant, between-individual variability; fathers did not show sudden changes in these variables. However, individuals did not significantly differ in the amount of sudden changes in negative observed communication. Additionally, mothers showed significant variability in gradual change in relationship confidence but not relationship dedication; gn",

However, Huston and Holmes conclude “The preponderance of the data fail to support the view that parenthood typically undermines marital satisfaction” (2004, p. 109). These disagreements arise primarily from the different methodologies that have been used to study the effect of the transition to parenthood; therefore, these methodologies are reviewed below. Impact of the Transition to Parenthood on Relationships Cross-Sectional Studies of Parenthood One of the most straightforward ways to examine the impact of having a child is to conduct a cross-sectional study comparing parents with non-parents. In the most recent meta-analysis of this research, parents reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction than non-parents (d = -.19; Twenge, Campbell, & Foster, 2003). Although this finding provides preliminary support for the notion that having a child is associated with declines in relationship quality, there are important limitations of cross-sectional designs in determining the true effect. Parents and non- parents are not equivalent groups and, as identified by Huston and Holmes (2004), parents may be less satisfied than non-parents for several other reasons: 1) they may be less satisfied even before having children; 2) having children serves as a barrier to divorce but not to dissatisfaction; 3) couples who become parents may differ from non-parents in other unmodeled but meaningful ways; and 4) a cross-sectional sample of parents is likely to include relationships of longer duration than a sample of non-parents. Thus, cross-sectional designs can provide only limited unmode",

To this end, we compared, in two ways, couples who received the typical premarital education through the religious organization where they were getting married with couples who received the empirically-based premarital education program (PREP). First, the sample was split into couples that did and did not receive PREP, and the best fitting models in each of the four samples was determined using the BIC procedures above. The results revealed no systematic differences based on the type of education received. In a second approach, receipt of PREP was entered in each best-fitting model as a predictor of parents’ changes attributable to the birth of their baby. In all cases, premarital education group did not significantly predict parents’ changes following birth (all ps > .25). Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that the impact of birth on relationship functioning does not depend on the type of premarital education received.

Similar patterns were seen for dedication for mothers (r = -.47, p < .001). However, for mothers but not fathers, the opposite relation was observed for relationship conflict.

Additionally, the present study examined two constructs that have not, to our knowledge, been examined as predictors of relationship functioning over the transition to parenthood: relationship commitment and confidence. Commitment has been shown to be an important construct in understanding general couple functioning and stability (Impett, Beals, & Peplau, 2001; Stanley & Markman, 1992); thus we wished to examine how it relates to the transition to parenthood. Additionally, one’s sense of confidence in the future of the relationship has been linked with not only better general relationship functioning, but also with lower levels of subsequent depression (Whitton et al., 2007). However, overly positive expectations about one’s relationship and partner have also been found to predict more deterioration in relationship satisfaction among newlywed couples, especially when paired with high levels of poor communication (McNulty & Karney, 2004). The Present Study In Study 1, we explore four questions. First, within parents, is there evidence of change in relationship functioning following the birth of the baby that is distinct from any change that was occurring before birth? While a true experiment cannot be conducted to assess the effects of the transition to parenthood, marked post-birth changes from trajectories of relationship changes that were otherwise expected would argue for a causal contribution of the transition to parenthood. Changes in several aspects of relationship functioning will be explored: relationship satisfaction, observed and self-reported communication, problem intensity, as well as relationship dedication and confidence.

Couples who had children from previous relationships or who did not complete an assessment at any point before having a child together were excluded. There were 132 couples who had their first child during the first eight years of the study (“parents”); these couples were used in the present study’s main analyses.

Such changes would be consistent with the fairly sudden declines in relationship functioning in the year after birth observed in the previous literature. Models 1c, 2c, and 3c indicate a more gradual shift (either increase or decrease) in the construct over several years following birth that differs from the rate of change in that construct before birth. Because the effect of the transition to parenthood has typically been examined in studies of limited duration, these gradual changes have not generally been examined. Finally, Models 1d, 2d, and 3d combine models b and c to include both a sudden vertical shift in the year after birth as well as more gradual changes in the construct in the following years. Models 1d, 2d, or 3d would be indicated if the initial changes that have been repeatedly documented after birth in the previous literature gradually improve (or even further deteriorate) after birth. Statistical Models: Multi-level analyses were conducted within the Hierarchical Linear Modeling program (HLM 6.03; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2004) and run separately by gender to permit changes over time to differ by gender.2 In the multi-level approach, estimates of change over time within an individual are generated at level one; level two accounts for any systematic variability due to the nesting of repeated assessments within individuals.

All available data from the couples that divorced and withdrew were included in the analyses below, allowing for estimates of change to be fit for the majority of these couples who did not provide full data. As expected based on previous studies, there were a few differences between the parents in Study 1 and the non-parents in Study 2 at the initial assessment. Parents were more confident about their relationships (F(1, 2",

The median personal income level was $20.000-29.999 and they were 90.1% White, 5.2% Latino, and 2.3% African American; 2.4% were of some other race/ethnicity. Seventy five percent of non-parents cohabited before marriage. Twenty seven percent of couples reported attending church at least once a week and, on average, couples described themselves as “somewhat” religious. During the course of the present study, 18 couples divorced and 22 withdrew from participation.

As expected based on previous studies, there were a few differences between the parents in Study 1 and the non-parents in Study 2 at the initial assessment. Parents were more confident about their relationships (F(1, 208) = 4.93, p < .05) and had more years of education (F(1, 216) = 6.93, p < .01) than non-parents. There were no significant differences on any other relationship or demographic variables. Parents and non-parents did not significantly differ in terms of what type of premarital education they received, χ2(2, N = 217) = 2.53, p > .25. Measures: The same measures described in Study 1 were used in Study 2. Data Analysis: To determine if non-parents experienced similar to changes to parents at the same point in their relationships, the time of each non-parent’s assessment was centered around mean time elapsed from the first assessment to birth for the parent sample utilized in study 1 (3.51 years).

      "value_text": "r the relationship from declines in relationship quality. In future studies, it will be important to identify these protective resources and supports. Third, several aspects of couples’ adaptive processes before birth predicted declines in relationship functioning after birth. Consistent with previous research (e.g., Cox et al., 1999; Crohan, 1996; Kluwer & Johnson, 2007), individuals who reported more problems with poor conflict management and problem intensity before birth showed significantly larger increases in these problems after birth. Additionally, more observed negative communication in mothers before birth predicted their reports of increases in post-birth poor conflict management, also consistent with previous research (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000). Thus, as in previous studies, high levels of negative communication before birth placed individuals at risk for greater post-birth increases in problematic communication. Interestingly, the present results also suggest that individuals with high pre-birth levels of positive relationship functioning were at risk for more post-birth deterioration in the positive aspects of their relationships. Specifically, the sudden declines in fathers’ and mothers’ relationship satisfaction as well as mothers’ dedication were larger when individuals showed higher levels of these constructs before birth; these findings are consistent with some (Belsky & Rovine, 1990) but not all (O’Brien & Peyton, 2002) previous literature. This pattern could indicate that couples who have the highest romantic connections find the transition to the tasks of parenting the most challenging, at least to the positive aspects of their relationships. Additionally, reporting more relationship confidence before birth was associated with greater increases r",

In all cases, the signs of the correlations between the intercepts and post-birth change were consistent with the analyses presented above (i.e., higher levels of both positive and negative relationship functioning before birth predicted greater relationship deterioration after birth). Doss et al. Page 14 J Pers Soc Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript demonstrated patterns of change consistent with an immediate or delayed impact of the transition to parenthood. For mothers, five of six areas of relationship functioning showed sudden deteriorations from their trajectories of relationship functioning before birth. That is, relationship satisfaction, self-reported problem intensity and poor conflict management, observed negative communication, and relationship confidence all showed sudden deteriorations. Fathers showed significant sudden deterioration in marital satisfaction, dedication, and negative observed communication; additionally, fathers showed significant gradual increases in problem intensity. When tested directly, mothers reported significantly larger, sudden increases than fathers in problem intensity and poor conflict management. For the average couple, no aspect of relationship functioning showed a positive effect of the transition to parenthood. In addition to mean changes in relationship functioning after birth, there was also significant between-individual variability in many of the variables examined. Variability in changes in some aspects of relationship functioning after birth was related to the levels at birth. For both g",

Prior to analysis, the time (in years) of each parent’s assessment was centered on the birth of the couple’s child so that the intercept represented the estimated mean level of the relationship construct at the time of birth. This strategy maximizes the ability to examine changes in levels and trajectories of the measured constructs before and after having a baby. Model estimation: Models 1a, 2a, and 3a were tested using parameterizations of an intercept- only model (Model 1a), an intercept + linear time model (Model 2a) and an intercept + linear time + quadratic time (Model 3a). Models 1b, 2b, and 3b were tested by adding a single variable (“level”) to the base models that had a value of zero for all assessments that occurred before the birth of a couple’s child and a value of 1 for all the assessments that occurred after the birth. For example, Model 3b was tested by fitting Equation 1 to the data: (1) Fixed effects at level one were allowed to vary randomly at level two if the difference in log likelihoods between models with and without the random effect was significant. Models 1c, 2c, 3c as well as 1d, 2d, and 3d were fit to the data using a piecewise model (e.g., Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002) that estimated a linear rate of change before birth and a separate linear rate of change after birth that captured deviations from the pre-birth rate of change.3 Model fit: To determine the best-fitting model of the eight potential models for each dependent variable, values of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) were calculated from the log-likelihood statistic obtained for each model using Full Maximum Likelihood estimation; these values were examined separately for each gender",

As with the parent sample, the type of premarital education received did not affect the selection of the best-fitting model. Participants: In Study 2, data from 86 couples who did not have children before or during the first eight years of the study (“non-parents”) were used as a non-equivalent control group. When they began participation, non-parents were 26.34 years old (SD = 4.91), on average, with Doss et al. Page 15 J Pers Soc Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript 15.08 years of education (SD = 1.77). The median personal income level was $20.000-29.999 and they were 90.1% White, 5.2% Latino, and 2.3% African American; 2.4% were of some other race/ethnicity. Seventy five percent of non-parents cohabited before marriage. Twenty seven percent of couples reported attending church at least once a week and, on average, couples described themselves as “somewhat” religious. During the course of the present study, 18 couples divorced and 22 withdrew from participation. This divorce rate is consistent with previous longitudinal research of non-parents that begins just after marriage (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000). All available data from the couples that divorced and withdrew were included in the analyses below, allowing for estimates of change to be fit for the majority of these couples who did not provide full data. As expected based on previous studies, there were a few differences between the parents in Study 1 and the non-parents in Study 2 at the initial assessment. Parents were more confident about their relationships (F(1, 2",
