Sample sizes for parents (132 couples) and non-parents (86 couples) were reported. Attrition and divorce rates were reported and accounted for in analyses. No mention of blinding procedures was found. | No explicit mention of randomization, control group, sample size, attrition, or blinding in the provided snippets.",
