- justification: The study used a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series design without randomization. A non-equivalent control group of non-parents was included. Sample sizes for parents (132 couples) and non-parents (86 couples) were reported. Attrition and divorce rates were reported and accounted for in analyses.
