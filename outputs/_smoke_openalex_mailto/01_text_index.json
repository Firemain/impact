    "text": "This longitudinal study examined the effect of the birth of the first child on relationship functioning using data from 218 couples (436 individuals) over the course of the first 8 years of marriage. Compared to pre-birth levels and trajectories, parents showed sudden deterioration following birth on observed and self-reported measures of positive and negative aspects of relationship functioning. The deterioration in these variables was small to medium in size and tended to persist throughout the remaining years of the study. Mothers and fathers showed similar amounts of change after birth. The amount of post-birth deterioration in relationship functioning varied systematically by several characteristics of the individual, the marriage, and the pregnancy itself. In a group of couples who did not have children, results indicated more gradual deterioration in relationship functioning during the first 8 years of marriage without the sudden changes seen in parents, suggesting that the results seen in the parent sample may be due to birth. Keywords Transition to parenthood; Parent; Relationship functioning; Prediction For decades, the marital and family literature has debated whether having a baby causes substantial declines in the average couple’s relationship. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this question. For married couples, the first child is often born within the first five years of marriage - a period that has been shown to hold the highest risk for divorce (Bramlett & Mosher, 2001). If parenthood truly is a crisis, as suggested by early investigators (e.g., Lemasters, 1957), then clarification of the impact of a baby’s birth could lead to increased understanding of early marital difficulties. Moreover, the quality of a couple’s relationship following a",

Moreover, the quality of a couple’s relationship following a baby’s birth has critical implications for numerous aspects of the baby’s early development, including physiological arousal (Gottman, Driver, & Tabares, 2002), attachment (e.g., De Wolff et al., 1997) and language development (e.g., Horwitz et al., 2003). Later child development (e.g., psychological, social, and school functioning) is also related to the status and quality of parent relationships (e.g., Amato, 2001, Davies & Cummings, 1994).

However, Huston and Holmes conclude “The preponderance of the data fail to support the view that parenthood typically undermines marital satisfaction” (2004, p. 109). These disagreements arise primarily from the different methodologies that have been used to study the effect of the transition to parenthood; therefore, these methodologies are reviewed below. Impact of the Transition to Parenthood on Relationships Cross-Sectional Studies of Parenthood One of the most straightforward ways to examine the impact of having a child is to conduct a cross-sectional study comparing parents with non-parents. In the most recent meta-analysis of this research, parents reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction than non-parents (d = -.19; Twenge, Campbell, & Foster, 2003). Although this finding provides preliminary support for the notion that having a child is associated with declines in relationship quality, there are important limitations of cross-sectional designs in determining the true effect. Parents and non- parents are not equivalent groups and, as identified by Huston and Holmes (2004), parents may be less satisfied than non-parents for several other reasons: 1) they may be less satisfied even before having children; 2) having children serves as a barrier to divorce but not to dissatisfaction; 3) couples who become parents may differ from non-parents in other unmodeled but meaningful ways; and 4) a cross-sectional sample of parents is likely to include relationships of longer duration than a sample of non-parents.

Thus, cross-sectional designs can provide only limited information on the effect of having children on relationship functioning. Longitudinal Studies Beginning in Pregnancy Given the critical limitations of cross-sectional designs, researchers have recruited pregnant couples and examined longitudinal changes in relationship functioning from pregnancy onward (e.g., Belsky, Lang, & Huston, 1986; Belsky & Rovine, 1990; Clements & Markman, 1996; Collins, Dunkel-Schetter, Lobel, & Scrimshaw, 1993; Cowan & Cowan, 2000; Gottman et al., 2002; Grote & Clark, 2001; O’Brien & Peyton, 2002; Rholes, Simpson, Campbell, & Grich, 2001). These longitudinal studies have shown declines in relationship satisfaction following birth of a full standard deviation or more in 20-59% of couples (see Cowan & Cowan, 1995) and “precipitous” drops in 70% of couples (e.g., Gottman et al., 2002). Indeed, one study showed that almost one third of partners fall into the clinical range of marital distress during the first 18 months after birth (Cowan & Cowan, 2000). Research has also demonstrated that parents show declines in positive relationship events and relationship-focused leisure time (e.g., MacDermid, Huston, & McHale, 1990), social support (Simpson, Rholes, Campbell, Tran, & Wilson, 2003), and increases in marital conflict (Cowan & Cowan, 2000). These deteriorations in relationship functioning after birth have been documented for couples from a wide range of ethnicities, including both Caucasian and African-American couples within the United States (Crohan, 1996) as well as for couples in Asia (Lu, 2006) and Europe (e.g., Clulow, 1982;",

Likewise, lesbian couples, who conceived a child through artificial insemination, evidenced decreases in love and increases in relationship conflict after the birth of their baby (Goldberg & Sayer, 2006). Therefore, some relationship deterioration after birth appears to be a relatively universal event for the average couple. At the same time, evidence suggests that there may be gender differences in the magnitude and timing of changes in relationship functioning after birth. Several studies suggest that mothers tend to demonstrate sudden declines in relationship satisfaction after birth while fathers show Doss et al. Page 2 J Pers Soc Psychol.

Additionally, some studies suggest that the magnitude of changes in relationship satisfaction differs by gender (e.g., O’Brien & Peyton, 2002), although the direction of effect may depend on the timing of measurement. Despite these important findings, there are limitations to the knowledge gained from longitudinal studies of parents. Similar to cross-sectional research, it is impossible to determine from these studies whether the declines that are typically seen after the birth would have occurred if the same couples had not had a baby. Further, there are two major reasons to suspect that these studies overestimate the impact of the transition to parenthood on relationship functioning (see Huston & Holmes, 2004). First, by first assessing couples during pregnancy, it is possible that the observed declines are simply a return to the couple’s baseline from a “honeymoon” of cooperation and togetherness that couples experience during pregnancy (Feeney et al., 2001). Thus, it seems important to examine trajectories both before and after birth. Second, given that relationship satisfaction declines on average during the early years of marriage (e.g., Clements & Markman, 1996; Huston, Caughlin, Houts, Smith, & George, 2001; Karney & Bradbury, 1997), natural maturation processes may be mistaken for the effects of birth. Inclusion of Non-Parents in Longitudinal Samples To partially address the last concern, studies have begun to utilize non-parents as a non- equivalent control group. With a non-parent group, it is possible to determine whether changes experienced after the birth of a child are also experienced by couples without children. The inclusion of",

The inclusion of non-parents as a non-equivalent control group allows one to investigate whether changes observed in parents after the birth of a baby are also observed in couples who do not have a baby. Indeed, results suggest that parents and non-parents tend to experience similar declines in relationship quality in most studies (e.g., Clements & Markman, 1996; Huston & Holmes, 2004; Kurdek, 1993; MacDermid et al., 1990; McHale & Huston, 1985; White & Booth, 1995), though there are exceptions (e.g., Crohan, 1996; Lawrence, Rothman, Cobb, Rothman, & Bradbury, 2008; Shapiro et al., 2000). However, parents seem to consistently show sharper declines in cohesion and relationship-focused activities compared to non-parents (e.g., Kurdek, 1993; MacDermid et al., 1990). In considering the implications of these studies, it is important to recognize that, because parents and non-parents differ in important ways before birth (e.g., MacDermid et al., 1990; Shapiro et al., 2000), changes that non-parents experience cannot be assumed to represent what parents would experience if they had not had a child. As a result, the field has yet to answer the central question of whether the transition to parenthood can be identified as the causal factor in the commonly noted declines in relationship quality among parents.

One essential piece of information that can address whether parenthood plays a causal role in relationship deterioration after birth has been largely ignored in the literature - the shape of change in relationship functioning before and after the birth of the first baby.1 By analyzing the levels and trajectories of change in relationship functioning before and after birth, a particular type of quasi-experimental design - an interrupted time-series (ITS) design (c.f., Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002) - can provide Doss et al.

An ITS design allows one to examine a series of measurements of a construct over time to determine if a particular event (here, birth of the first child) affected that construct’s time series in a predictable fashion. Within the context of the transition to parenthood, we can ask whether the birth affects ongoing changes in relationship functioning in predictable ways. In particular, given the changes that were occurring before birth, an ITS design can illuminate whether relationships show no additional change after birth, whether they show a sudden increase or decrease in relationship constructs (i.e., a change in level) following birth, or whether they show modifications to the rate of change in a construct from pre- to post-birth (i.e., a change in slope). For example, using an ITS design, we can ask whether there is a sudden increase/ decrease in relationship satisfaction following the birth of the baby as well as whether any changes/stability before birth in relationship satisfaction continued to hold after the birth of the baby. As a result, this approach isolates change that can be attributed to birth from change that was expected based on ongoing changes in the couples’ relationship. Additionally, by following couples for years after birth, this approach also allows us to determine whether the initial changes that couples experience after birth persist over time. Combining ITS designs with the series of statistical model fitting procedures used in the present study, we can also determine the most parsimonious model of change in relationship constructs over time for both parents and non-parents.

For example, it may be that a linear or quadratic model of change is the most parsimonious model for non-parents but that models for parents require additional shifts in intercepts or slopes as discussed above. Therefore, the combination of a model-fitting and ITS approach permits direct statistical comparison of different change models and, within each of these models, statistical tests of various model components. ITS designs have been used investigate the effects of various interventions (e.g., Biglan, Metzler, & Ary, 1994; Tilden & Shepherd, 1987; Velicer, 1994) using both within- and between-person time series, but it has not, to our knowledge, been applied to the transition to parenthood. If the assumptions of the model are met, causal conclusions from an ITS design are nearly as strong as from a randomized design (Shadish et al., 2002). Predictors of Relationship Changes over the Transition to Parenthood To this point, we have been discussing the transition to parenthood as though all couples evidence deterioration in relationship functioning. However, not all couples experience the same changes over the transition to parenthood; as noted earlier, approximately one third (e.g., Shapiro, Gottman, & Carrère, 2000) to one half (e.g., Belsky & Hsieh, 1998; Belsky & Rovine, 1990) of couples evidence stability or increases in relationship satisfaction or love over the transition to parenthood.

One way to understand changes in post-birth relationship functioning is by using the conceptual framework of the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation (VSA) model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995). In the VSA model, changes in relationship quality are understood to be a function of three interrelated constructs: enduring vulnerabilities, stressful events, and adaptive processes. Enduring vulnerabilities of the individual and the couple (e.g., limited education, cohabitation history) increase chances of experiencing events as stressful and adapting poorly to those events. Additionally, although all the couples in the current study’s sample of parents 1Previous studies have indirectly examined the shape of change in relationship variables beginning in either pregnancy or shortly following birth as part of examining assumptions of their statistical tests (e.g., O’Brien & Peyton, 2002; Schulz, Cowan, & Cowan, 2006). Additionally, a recent study (Lawrence, Nylen, & Cobb, 2007) fit separate slopes of change before and after birth. However, no studies have examined the statistical fit of various models of change in relationship functioning before and after birth; it is this addition that is the central contribution of the present study.

For example, the timing of the birth and the gender of the baby could alter the impact of the first baby on relationship functioning. Finally, couples have different levels of adaptive processes (e.g., communication, commitment) to help them cope with the stresses placed on their relationship functioning after birth. The VSA model suggests that each of these components, enduring vulnerabilities, the nature and timing of stressful events, and the degree to which couples can engage in adaptive processes, must be considered to understand changes in relationship functioning (Karney & Bradbury, 1995). Thus, the hypotheses for the current study are organized around this VSA model. Before detailing those hypotheses, we first discuss the existing literature on predictors of post-birth functioning by these three constructs. Enduring Vulnerabilities Several studies have investigated how various enduring vulnerabilities impact the transition to parenthood. For example, poor functioning in individuals’ families of origin has been shown to predict declines in both marital satisfaction (Cowan & Cowan, 2000; Perren, Wyl, Burgin, Simoni, & Klitzing, 2005) and observed communication (Perren et al., 2005) over the transition to parenthood. However, the literature is mixed on whether conflict in both partners’ family of origin (Perren et al., 2005) or only the husband’s family of origin (Cowan & Cowan, 2000) is predictive of declines in relationship functioning. Furthermore, although not investigated over the transition to parenthood, divorce and conflict in the family of origin may have differential impacts on satisfaction (e.g., Story,",

Furthermore, although not investigated over the transition to parenthood, divorce and conflict in the family of origin may have differential impacts on satisfaction (e.g., Story, Karney, Lawrence, & Bradbury, 2004). Additionally, there is a growing body of literature suggesting that couples who cohabit before marriage are at higher risk for a number of subsequent marital difficulties (e.g., Cohan, & Kleinbaum, 2002; Stanley, Whitton, & Markman, 2004). The effect of premarital cohabitation on relationship functioning after birth has yet to be examined to our knowledge. Finally, level of religiosity has been shown to moderate the impact of the transition to parenthood on marital satisfaction. Highly religious mothers experienced greater gains in marital satisfaction after birth than those with lower levels of religiousness (Nock, Sanchez, & Wright, in press). Nature of Stressful Event Belsky and Rovine (1990) found that couples with unplanned pregnancies saw more deterioration in wife-reported (but not husband-reported) love, conflict, and ambivalence. Therefore, in the present study, individuals’ reports of whether the pregnancy was planned were used as predictors of change after birth. Additionally, the existing evidence is mixed on whether having a child shortly after marriage is a risk factor for subsequent declines in relationship functioning. Belsky and Rovine (1990) found that couples who had been together longer before birth showed smaller increases in relationship conflict and smaller decreases in husbands’ reports of love.

Additionally, the amount of personal income at birth has been examined as a predictor of the transition to parenthood. One study found that higher income served as a buffer against increases in marital conflict and fathers’ ambivalence after birth (Belsky & Rovine, 1990) while other studies (e.g., O’Brien & Peyton, 2002) have found no effect. One possible explanation for these mixed findings is that income is a single indicator of what is likely a complex construct composed of financial resources, employment pressures, and financial stressors. In the present study, both current income and amount of financial stress are used as predictors to separate these constructs. In the present study, these variables are considered to reflect differing aspects of the stressful event (rather than enduring vulnerabilities) because they varied across time Doss et al.

Finally, the impact of the child’s gender on relationship functioning is also mixed: some studies have shown that having a female child places couples at higher risk for relationship problems after birth (e.g., Cox et al., 1999; Raley & Bianchi, 2006) while other studies have found no effect of child gender (e.g., Kurdek, 1993). This study will examine the impact of child gender on relationship functioning. Adaptive Processes Perhaps the most examined predictors of change after the transition to parenthood are levels of relationship functioning during pregnancy. Higher levels of both self-reported (e.g., Cox, Paley, Burchinal, & Payne, 1999; Crohan, 1996; Kluwer & Johnson, 2007) and observed (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000) poor communication or conflict during pregnancy have been consistently found to predict larger declines in relationship functioning. However, previous studies have been mixed as to whether having higher levels of positive relationship qualities (e.g., satisfaction, romance) are associated with more or less deterioration after birth. In one study, greater marital satisfaction assessed just after birth predicted fewer declines in marital satisfaction during the following three years (O’Brien & Peyton, 2002). However, another study found that higher levels of romance during pregnancy predicted significantly greater deterioration in husbands’ self-reported love as well as increases in both husbands’ and wives’ reported levels of relationship conflict (Belsky & Rovine, 1990).

Additionally, the present study examined two constructs that have not, to our knowledge, been examined as predictors of relationship functioning over the transition to parenthood: relationship commitment and confidence. Commitment has been shown to be an important construct in understanding general couple functioning and stability (Impett, Beals, & Peplau, 2001; Stanley & Markman, 1992); thus we wished to examine how it relates to the transition to parenthood. Additionally, one’s sense of confidence in the future of the relationship has been linked with not only better general relationship functioning, but also with lower levels of subsequent depression (Whitton et al., 2007). However, overly positive expectations about one’s relationship and partner have also been found to predict more deterioration in relationship satisfaction among newlywed couples, especially when paired with high levels of poor communication (McNulty & Karney, 2004). The Present Study In Study 1, we explore four questions. First, within parents, is there evidence of change in relationship functioning following the birth of the baby that is distinct from any change that was occurring before birth? While a true experiment cannot be conducted to assess the effects of the transition to parenthood, marked post-birth changes from trajectories of relationship changes that were otherwise expected would argue for a causal contribution of the transition to parenthood.

However, rather than simply fitting a linear or quadratic model used in previous research, the present analyses seeks to fit the ITS model that best estimates the type and shape of this decline so that the most accurate picture of post-birth change can be obtained and tested.

The median personal income level was $20.000-29.999 and they were 89.8% White and 8.0% Latino; 2.2% were of some other race/ethnicity. Sixty eight percent of couples cohabited before marriage. Twenty seven percent of couples reported attending church at least once a week and, on average, couples described themselves as “somewhat” religious. Forty six percent of couples give birth to a girl; additionally, approximately 10% of both fathers and mothers reported that their pregnancy was unplanned. During the course of the present study, three couples divorced and three couples withdrew from the study; however, all available data from these couples was utilized in analyses. Procedures: Couples were recruited before marriage through the religious organizations that would perform their weddings. These religious organizations were randomly assigned to require couples using their wedding services to either receive the naturally occurring premarital education services within the religious organization or the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP; Markman, Stanley, & Blumberg, 2002; Stanley, Blumberg, & Markman, 1999).

Sixty-two percent of the parent sample completed PREP; the remainder of the sample received naturally occurring premarital education. The naturally-occurring interventions reflected “treatment as usual” for premarital education efforts. Couples in that condition received an average of 5.9 hours of premarital education that reflected the gamut of approached typically conducted by religious organizations (see Stanley et al., 2001 for more details). Below, we test whether couples who received PREP differed from couples who received the naturally-occurring intervention during the transition to parenthood. As part of the larger study, couples were asked to complete measures and videotaped interactions before they were married and prior to premarital education (T1), just after education (T2), and yearly thereafter (T3-T10). However, in the present study, data on the dependent variables from the T1 assessment were omitted from analyses to avoid confounding change during the education program with natural change over time. Except for demographic information that was not expected to change over time (e.g., ethnicity) and, where noted, the following measures were administered at every follow-up assessment. During each laboratory visit, partners completed questionnaires individually and completed a videotaped 10-15 minute problem-solving discussion together.

Measures of Relationship Variables: Marital satisfaction: We used the first item from the Marital Adjustment Test (MAT; Locke & Wallace, 1959) to assess satisfaction. The item asks participants to rate the “degree of happiness” they experience in their relationships on a 1 (very unhappy) to 7 (perfectly happy) scale. Consistent with previous calls (e.g., Fincham & Bradbury, 1987; Huston & Vangelisti, 1995), this item, rather than the full MAT, was used to obtain a pure measure of marital satisfaction that was not confounded with communication and commitment. This single item of satisfaction has been found to provide high levels of information about individuals’ relationship satisfaction across a broad range of relationship functioning (Funk & Rogge, 2007) Observed negative communication: The Interactional Dimensions Coding System, a global coding system for couples’ discussions of relationship problems (Julien, Markman, & Lindahl, 1989; Kline et al., 2004), was used to code couples’ videotaped problem discussions. Intercoder reliability was high, with intraclass correlations ranging from .66 to .95 (Mdn = .87; Kline et al., 2004). This study used only the negative communication subscale (made up of withdrawal, denial, conflict, dominance, and negative affect, α = .86 for mothers; .88 for fathers). Relationship confidence: We used the 10-item Confidence Scale (Stanley, Hoyer, & Trathen, 1994; Whitton et al., 2007) to measure one’s sense that he/she and the partner can effectively manage their relationship and stay together.

Participants rated each item from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Cronbach’s alpha was .83 for mothers and .79 for fathers. Relationship dedication: We used the 14-item Dedication Scale from the revised Commitment Inventory (Stanley & Markman, 1992) to measure dedication. This measure captures willingness to sacrifice for the relationship, intrinsic desire to maintain the relationship for the long term, considering the relationship a priority, and couple identity. Participants rated each item on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale. The Dedication Scale has shown acceptable levels of internal consistency across a range of samples (e.g., Adams & Jones, 1997; Stanley & Markman, 1992). In the current sample, the internal consistency is lowest at T1 (mothers, α = .52; for fathers, α = .68) due to restriction of range; almost all couples reported being very dedicated to their relationship. At later time points, reliability is higher (e.g., at T7, α = .74 for mothers and α = .76 for fathers). Poor conflict management: The Communication Danger Signs Scale (Stanley & Markman, 1997) was used to assess self-reported conflict management. It has demonstrated adequate validity and reliability in two random samples (Johnson et al., 2002; Stanley, Whitton, & Markman, 2004). Only the seven (of eight) items related to the frequency of negative interaction patterns were used.

Problem intensity: The Marital Agendas Protocol (MAP; Notarius & Vanzetti, 1983) asks participants to rate the intensity of their relationship problems in 16 areas (e.g., communication, money, sex) on a 0 to 100 scale. Scores reflect the average intensity across all areas, and higher scores reflect the intensity of how much of a problem the issues typically faced by young couples are from the participant’s perspective. The MAP has been shown to be reliable and discriminates distressed from non-distressed couples (Notarius & Vanzetti, 1983). In the present study, for mothers, α = .70; for fathers, α = .75.

Family of origin: Two aspects of participants’ families of origin were explored: the level of interparental conflict and whether or not the participant’s parents divorced. Three items regarding intensity and frequency of interparental conflict were derived from Grych, Seid, and Fincham’s (1992) Children’s Perceptions of Interparental Conflict (CPIC) scale; a modified response scale was used in the present study that ranges from 1 (definitely false) to 6 (definitely true).

Individual, rather than couples’, reports were used in analyses below to permit partners to disagree about whether the pregnancy was planned.

Internal consistency was adequate for this two-item scale (α = .73 for fathers and .77 for mothers). Theoretical Models: Twelve potential models were fit to each individual’s data (Figure 1) to identify the best fitting model for six constructs: marital satisfaction, negative observed communication, poor conflict management, problem intensity, relationship confidence, and dedication. These models were based on Huston and Holmes’ (2004) suggestion that post-birth change could occur gradually or suddenly and be maintained or not over time.

Such changes would be consistent with the fairly sudden declines in relationship functioning in the year after birth observed in the previous literature. Models 1c, 2c, and 3c indicate a more gradual shift (either increase or decrease) in the construct over several years following birth that differs from the rate of change in that construct before birth. Because the effect of the transition to parenthood has typically been examined in studies of limited duration, these gradual changes have not generally been examined. Finally, Models 1d, 2d, and 3d combine models b and c to include both a sudden vertical shift in the year after birth as well as more gradual changes in the construct in the following years. Models 1d, 2d, or 3d would be indicated if the initial changes that have been repeatedly documented after birth in the previous literature gradually improve (or even further deteriorate) after birth. Statistical Models: Multi-level analyses were conducted within the Hierarchical Linear Modeling program (HLM 6.03; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, & Congdon, 2004) and run separately by gender to permit changes over time to differ by gender.2 In the multi-level approach, estimates of change over time within an individual are generated at level one; level two accounts for any systematic variability due to the nesting of repeated assessments within individuals.

Model estimation: Models 1a, 2a, and 3a were tested using parameterizations of an intercept- only model (Model 1a), an intercept + linear time model (Model 2a) and an intercept + linear time + quadratic time (Model 3a). Models 1b, 2b, and 3b were tested by adding a single variable (“level”) to the base models that had a value of zero for all assessments that occurred before the birth of a couple’s child and a value of 1 for all the assessments that occurred after the birth. For example, Model 3b was tested by fitting Equation 1 to the data: (1) Fixed effects at level one were allowed to vary randomly at level two if the difference in log likelihoods between models with and without the random effect was significant. Models 1c, 2c, 3c as well as 1d, 2d, and 3d were fit to the data using a piecewise model (e.g., Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002) that estimated a linear rate of change before birth and a separate linear rate of change after birth that captured deviations from the pre-birth rate of change.3 Model fit: To determine the best-fitting model of the eight potential models for each dependent variable, values of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) were calculated from the log-likelihood statistic obtained for each model using Full Maximum Likelihood estimation; these values were examined separately for each gender",

Log- likelihood and BIC statistics for each model are available from the first author. Testing gender differences: Once the best fitting models were identified for each gender, these models were run for both partners simultaneously following the guidelines presented by Raudenbush, Brennan, and Barnett (1995) for couple data. For example, Model 3b was fit using Equation 2: (2) By constraining the estimates of both partners to be equal and testing the deviance of the constrained and unconstrained models, it was possible to test whether the estimates for fathers and mothers were significantly different from each other. When models differed by gender, all relevant parameters were included in both models to permit testing across spouses. Prediction of change after birth: For those variables that demonstrated significant variability in post-birth changes attributable to the transition to parenthood, those changes were first correlated with the level of that variable at birth. Examination of these correlations revealed whether couples who were high or low in a variable before birth (e.g., high or low marital satisfaction) tended to show more or less change after birth.

Using the Latent Variable Regression procedure in HLM 6.03, an individual’s estimated amount of change attributable to birth (e.g., βh2i or βw2i in Equation 2) was predicted simultaneously from that individual’s estimated level of the dependent variable before birth (i.e., βh0i or βw0i in Equation 2) and from the level-two predictor of interest. The value of the dependent variable before birth was included as a control variable because pre-birth levels and post-birth changes were correlated for several of the dependent variables. Because we were interested in whether the predictor added information above and beyond that contained in the dependent variable itself, the estimated level of the dependent variable at birth was entered in all prediction equations.

However, although fathers reported significant post-birth changes in five of six domains of relationship functioning, changes in poor conflict management after birth did not differ from what was expected given changes already occurring before birth. Regarding the nature of the changes that occurred, all of the relationship constructs that demonstrated effects of the transition to parenthood showed significant and sudden worsening of the relationship in either fathers or mothers (either declines in positives or increases in negatives; Table 2). Specifically, marital satisfaction showed significant drops following the transition to parenthood of 2.81 points for mothers (d = -0.71, p < .01)5 and 1.81 points for fathers (d = -0.45, p < .05).6 Following the transition to parenthood, both fathers (d = 0.61, p < .01) and mothers (d = 0.57, p < .05) showed sudden increases in negative observed communication.

For example, although both fathers and mothers in general showed significant sudden decreases in relationship satisfaction after birth, approximately 7% of mothers and 15% of fathers reported sudden gains in relationship satisfaction over the transition to parenthood. Prediction of Change in Relationship Functioning After Birth: Given the variability of change in relationship functioning after birth, predictors of this variability were explored as a fourth question in this study. Constructs that did not demonstrate significant variability in sudden or gradual changes after birth were not examined further. Prediction from level of variable at birth: To investigate whether couples’ level of relationship functioning at birth was related to changes in that same variable after birth, correlations between the intercept and post-birth changes (in the tau matrix) were examined.

Similar patterns were seen for dedication for mothers (r = -.47, p < .001). However, for mothers but not fathers, the opposite relation was observed for relationship conflict.

Thus, the rank order of individuals after birth remains similar for measures of both positive and negative relationship functioning. Second, we divided individuals into three groups based on their scores in the year preceding birth: those scoring 1 standard deviation or more above the mean, within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 1 standard deviation or more below the mean. For all three measures of positive relationship functioning (fathers’ and mothers’ relationship satisfaction and mothers’ dedication), plots revealed that it was the high-functioning individuals who declined most after birth (rather than the lowest-functioning individuals declining the least). However, for two measures of negative relationship functioning (mothers’ reports of poor conflict management and problem intensity), the opposite pattern held; specifically, the lowest-functioning group showed the largest post-birth increases in negative relationship functioning.

Study 2: Non-Parent Sample Before the results in the parent sample can be confidently attributed to the transition to parenthood, it is important to rule out common alternative explanations to which the ITS design used in Study 1 is particularly susceptible (Shadish et al., 2002). The primary threat to interpretation is the potential effect of history - that another variable or event acted at the time of birth to produce the effect that we attributed to parenthood. A second alternative explanation is instrumentation - a change in how data are collected, kept, or scored. For example, a systematic data entry or scoring error occurring for the assessment approximately four years into the study could be masquerading as the effect of birth in Study 1. In Study 2, a sample of non-parents is used to examine whether threats to internal validity (i.e., history and instrumentation) can explain the changes after birth observed in the parent sample.

This divorce rate is consistent with previous longitudinal research of non-parents that begins just after marriage (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000). All available data from the couples that divorced and withdrew were included in the analyses below, allowing for estimates of change to be fit for the majority of these couples who did not provide full data.

Results indicated that non- parents, who completed the same measures and procedures as parents, did not show changes similar to those in Study 1 that we have attributed to birth. Therefore, instrumentation is an unlikely explanation of the results in the parent sample. In addition to history and instrumentation, Shadish and colleagues (2002) identify a third threat to ITS designs - selection. Selection effects could potentially explain the results observed in Study 1 if different subsamples of couples completed measures before and after the birth of the baby. However, examinations of the data from both Study 1 and Study 2 did not reveal differential study dropout immediately before or following these time points. Therefore, based on these results, the most likely cause of the sudden deterioration in the parent sample remains the birth of the first baby. General Discussion Sudden and Gradual Changes after Birth The primary aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the birth of the first child on marital functioning by using an ITS design. This approach addressed several of the most pressing concerns about the previous literature and was able to: 1) provide an estimate of change in relationship functioning attributable to birth by separating change after birth from change that was occurring in the couple before birth; 2) determine whether couples generally recover from the effects of birth or if instead these effects are stable or even worsen with time; 3) examine gender differences in the effect of the transition to parenthood; and 4) compare parents and non-parents in appropriate ways.

Across positive and negative aspects of the relationship and across both self-report and observed variables, the birth of the first child has a small to medium negative effect on both fathers’ and mothers’ relationship functioning. The magnitude of this deterioration was smaller than many previous studies of the transition to parenthood (e.g., Cowan & Cowan, 1995, 2000;Gottman et al., 2002) but consistent with others (e.g., Kurdek, 1995; Simpson et al., 2003). The smaller effects of birth revealed in the present study support criticisms of previous studies of the transition to parenthood. Specifically, as noted by Houston and Holmes (2004), previous studies may have inadvertently captured a “honeymoon” period for the couples during pregnancy and confounded typical relationship deterioration occurring even before birth with problems attributable to the transition to parenthood. The present study also answered previous calls (e.g., Huston & Vangelisti, 1995) to investigate the stability of the effect of the transition to parenthood. Results indicated that the negative effects on relationship functioning tended to persist through at least the first four years after birth. Indeed, there was not a single variable that showed evidence of even non-significant recovery after birth; parenthood tended to be experienced as sudden changes that persisted over time. In contrast to the general pattern of sudden and persistent change, fathers’ relationship confidence and problem intensity continued to deteriorate in the years following birth.

Had we instead fit only linear and quadratic slopes over time (omitting the possibility of sudden or gradual changes occurring at birth) and compared the amount of change between parents and non-parents, we would have concluded, along with previous studies (e.g., MacDermid et al., 1990; McHale & Huston, 1985), that parents and non-parents showed similar types of change over the course of the first few years of marriage. Instead, the results of the present study suggest that parents and non-parents generally show similar amounts of decline in overall relationship functioning over the first eight years of marriage, but that these changes tend to occur suddenly following the birth of the baby for parents and more gradually over time for non-parents. Additionally, parents showed clear increases in negativity, conflict, and problem intensity following the birth of a child whereas non-parents did not show such changes at the same point in time nor did they show such declines over time more generally. Given the sudden nature of the negative relationship changes following birth for parents, the most likely explanation is that they are caused by stressors encountered during the transition to parenthood that are not handled well.

In the present study, although the average individual’s relationship functioning deteriorated, some individuals reported improvements over the transition to parenthood, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Belsky & Hsieh, 1998; Belsky & Rovine, 1990). The variability in individuals’ reactions and adjustments to childbirth is important because it suggests avenues for future research on risk and resiliency during this typically stressful time. To understand why some couples deteriorate while others improve after birth, Karney and Bradbury’s (1995) VSA model is especially useful. Consistent with that model, the present study focused on three constructs that are understood to impact changes in relationship satisfaction over time: 1) enduring vulnerabilities; 2) the nature of the stressful event (birth), and 3) the couples’ quality of adaptive processes. First, several types of enduring vulnerabilities predicted relationship deterioration after birth. For mothers, a history of parental divorce or conflict was predictive of larger decreases in relationship satisfaction after birth. In previous studies, relationship functioning in the family of origin, particularly in that of the female partner, has been found to impact couples’ current relationship functioning (e.g., D’Onofrio et al., 2007; Sanders, Halford, & Behrens, 1999; Story et al., 2004).

This difference is perhaps due to a combination of prior risk factors and the nature of the way their relationships initially formed (Stanley, Rhoades, & Markman, 2006). The increased risk of cohabiting couples is consistent with previous research suggesting that those who cohabit before marriage (e.g., Kamp Dush, Cohan, & Amato, 2003; Stanley et al., 2004) are more at risk for marital problems and divorce. Second, several characteristics of the stressful event (birth) predicted changes in couples’ relationship functioning after birth. Specifically, fathers who had a child more quickly following marriage evidenced more declines in relationship satisfaction after birth than parents who waited longer after getting married. This finding is consistent with some (e.g., Belsky & Rovine, 1990) but not all (O’Brien & Peyton, 2002) research. It may be that couples that have been married longer have more time to develop a shared understanding of relationship responsibilities and goals that help to buffer them from the stressors of increased childcare and general disorganization after birth. Interestingly, whether the baby was planned was generally unrelated to post-birth functioning in this sample. In interpreting this finding, it should be noted Doss et al. Page 18 J Pers Soc Psychol.

In previous research, the post-birth relationship outcomes for these two types of couples have been shown to be very different (Cowan & Cowan, 2000); therefore, combining these groups in the present study may cause the overall prediction to be non-significant. Additionally, the gender of the baby affected parents’ relationship functioning after birth, with female children leading to larger decreases in mothers’ relationship satisfaction and larger increases in fathers’ reports of problem intensity. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown male children are associated with lower rates of divorce and higher marital satisfaction (see Raley & Bianchi, 2006), possibly because fathers of girls are less active in childcare than fathers of boys. Pregnant couples may need specific help in understanding and communicating their expectations about the gender of their babies and childcare so that they can stop declines in relationship functioning from occurring. Finally, consistent with previous research (e.g., Belsky & Rovine, 1990), lower individual incomes (but not more financial stress) tended to predict more deterioration in fathers’ relationship functioning after birth. Therefore, it appears that the additional resources, supports, and alternative sources of self-esteem afforded by a higher income, rather than reduced financial stress, serves to buffer the relationship from declines in relationship quality.

Consistent with previous research (e.g., Cox et al., 1999; Crohan, 1996; Kluwer & Johnson, 2007), individuals who reported more problems with poor conflict management and problem intensity before birth showed significantly larger increases in these problems after birth. Additionally, more observed negative communication in mothers before birth predicted their reports of increases in post-birth poor conflict management, also consistent with previous research (e.g., Shapiro et al., 2000). Thus, as in previous studies, high levels of negative communication before birth placed individuals at risk for greater post-birth increases in problematic communication. Interestingly, the present results also suggest that individuals with high pre-birth levels of positive relationship functioning were at risk for more post-birth deterioration in the positive aspects of their relationships. Specifically, the sudden declines in fathers’ and mothers’ relationship satisfaction as well as mothers’ dedication were larger when individuals showed higher levels of these constructs before birth; these findings are consistent with some (Belsky & Rovine, 1990) but not all (O’Brien & Peyton, 2002) previous literature. This pattern could indicate that couples who have the highest romantic connections find the transition to the tasks of parenting the most challenging, at least to the positive aspects of their relationships. Additionally, reporting more relationship confidence before birth was associated with greater increases",

Additionally, reporting more relationship confidence before birth was associated with greater increases in negative relationship constructs (problem intensity and poor conflict management) after birth. Relationship confidence has not been previously examined over the transition to parenthood, but the risks of having unrealistically high relationship expectations have been demonstrated in newlywed couples, especially those with poor communication (McNulty & Karney, 2004). Taken together, these results suggest that the impact of the transition to parenthood may be especially potent when couples are at the extremes of both positive and negative relationship constructs. However, it should be noted that regression to the mean could also explain the associations of the positive (but not negative) relationship behaviors with changes after birth. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution until they are replicated in future research. Doss et al. Page 19 J Pers Soc Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1.

    "text": "Despite the predictive ability of these variables, we should note that many other variables were not predictive of change in relationship functioning after birth. Given that the present study defines the “effect” of birth differently than previous studies, we wanted to include many of the predictors that have been used in previous studies. Many to most of these predictors had received equivocal support in previous research; the results in the present study were similar. There are likely several reasons for the difficulty in differentiating couples who will and will not have relationship difficulties after the transition to parenthood; we focus on three here. First, predicting change after birth requires predicting the development of some important aspects of the relationship that simply do not exist before birth. For example, the most commonly reported conflict after birth is division of childcare (e.g., Cowan & Cowan, 2000), something that couples have not previously dealt with. A second reason for the difficulty in predicting change after birth is that factors that cannot be known before birth may be some of the strongest determinants of change in relationship functioning over the transition to parenthood (e.g., child temperament; Kochanska, Friesenborg, Lange, & Martel, 2004). Third, in the present study, we purposely tested a restrictive definition of a predictor. Consistent with our desire to separate change in the relationship attributable to changes before birth from changes attributable solely to the transition to parenthood, we tested whether variables would be able to predict changes following birth after controlling for the couples’ functioning at the time of birth. In other words, the only predictors identified in the present study were those that had an",

In other words, the only predictors identified in the present study were those that had an additional effect on relationship functioning following birth above and beyond the effect they had already had on relationship functioning up to that point. Future research may wish to expand the list of predictors. Limitations and Future Directions The results of the present study should be considered in the context of its limitations. Most importantly, generalizability may be somewhat limited to due to several factors. While the sample is reasonably representative of the metro area from which it was drawn, and much effort was expended not to obtain a convenience sample (Stanley et al., 2001), participants were mainly well educated and Caucasian. Additionally, all couples received some form of premarital education and were married within a religious organization. The potential impact of these factors on generalizability is tempered for three reasons. First, analyses demonstrated that the type of education received did not systematically affect the shape of change in the relationship variables; furthermore, type of intervention did not significantly predict the amount of change following the birth of the baby. Second, because of the way participants were recruited, the selection effects are expected to be minimal. Each participating couple was required to receive premarital education through the religious organization that would perform their wedding (as a condition of being married there); therefore, this was not a sample that purposely sought out premarital education. Furthermore, over 75% (Johnson et al., 2002; Stanley, Amato, Johnson, & Markman, 2006;",

Furthermore, over 75% (Johnson et al., 2002; Stanley, Amato, Johnson, & Markman, 2006; Sullivan & Bradbury, 1997) of couples that receive premarital education do so through a religious organization. Third, although all couples in the present study were married by an official associated with a religious organization, this is true for most couples in the United States (Stanley et al., 2006). Additionally, the average couple described themselves as only “somewhat religious” and only 27 percent of couples attend church once a week or more. Nevertheless, it could be that the findings here most specifically generalize to those couples who seek to marry in a religious organization. A second limitation of the present study was that we were unable to separate the impact of the first child on changes in relationship functioning from the impact of later children. Assuming that later children have a negative impact on relationship functioning, this impact may be reflected in the gradual changes (and, to a lesser extent, sudden changes) seen after the birth of the first child. Future studies with more frequent assessments could address the issue of multiple children more directly. Doss et al. Page 20 J Pers Soc Psychol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 1.

While these types of designs have some advantages over studies that specifically target future parents (for a review of these advantages, see Huston & Holmes, 2004), it meant that the timing of the assessment before birth varied between couples. For some couples, the final pre-birth assessment (from which the values of the time-varying predictors were obtained) occurred before the couple was pregnant while it occurred in the third trimester for other couples.

In future studies, it would be useful to combine an ITS design with measures that are more specific to changes and challenges faced by couples over the transition to parenthood. For example, it may be that that relationship constructs other than those measured in the present study (e.g., prenatal expectations; Lawrence, Nylen, & Cobb, 2007) may be more predictive of relationship change after the birth of the baby. Additionally, to expand our understanding of the transition to parenthood, examination of the role the couple relationship plays in the developing coparenting relationship is critical. The data set used here contains an unusually broad assessment of relationship constructs, allowing for tests of various relationship effects over time. However, since child variables such as temperament are likely to have important impacts on relationship functioning after birth (Kochanska et al., 2004), our ability to understand this process would be enhanced by inclusion of these variables in future studies. Finally, the internal reliability of some of our measures (e.g., dedication) was low at some of the initial assessment points, likely due to a restriction of range in newlywed couples.",

For the average couple, these effects were negative, small to medium in magnitude, and consistent across a number of relationship domains. Moreover, these effects tended to be sudden and persist over time. Additionally, results revealed significant variability in changes after birth. This variability was systematically related to a number of factors associated with the individual, the marriage, and characteristics of the birth itself.",
