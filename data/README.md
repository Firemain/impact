# SCImago Data

Place the SCImago Journal Rank CSV file here as `scimago_journals.csv`.

Download it from: https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php

The scoring module will use this file for journal quartile (Q1-Q4) and SJR lookups.
If the file is not present, the SCImago component of the JournalScore will be skipped gracefully.
